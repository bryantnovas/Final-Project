#Dollar Pizza APP#

studying in GA can get very expensive, specially if you have to buy food!!!, for that I put my two cents an created an app that you can find pizza for a dollar close to were you are :).

##using oauth##
this app requires to to log in, using a gem called omnioauthm I was able to implement solution to sign in using an account for one this social networks: Facebook, Twitter, Google+ or Linkedin

##about the app##
this is app was build using ruby on rails, I used bower to manage the front end dependencies like: jquery for interactivity, gmaps to render maps with all locations on screen and bootstrap for styling.

##Instuctions##
1. click on the sign in button and select the desired social network to be used.

1. you're going to see a screen asking for your credentials, the app will not store any usernames or passwords so please log in with your correct info.

1. then you'll have to give the app permission to see some of your info (again not password or usernames, just your human name and profile picture)

1. after verifying your adentity the app will redirect you to a the site where the map is and it will display your current position and where the closest pizzas places are.


#Enjoy your meal!!! :)#
